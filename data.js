<div class="en">
ויהי ערב ויהי בקר. It is noteworthy that the Torah here did not write ויהי לילה, ויהי יום, but it wrote ערב. This is the period when G’d made the light of the first day fade. The subsequent expression ויהי בקר refers to the morning after the night when dawn rose. At this point the first of the 6 “days” of G’d’s creative activity of which He spoke in the Ten Commandments had come to an end. After that the second “day” began and is introduced with the words ויאמר אלוקים יהי רקיע בתוך המים. The purpose of our verse here was not to tell us that that evening and morning were part of the same day. The verse was needed only to tell us how the 6 “days” are accounted for, i.e. that the morning completed the night, which was the end of that day and the beginning of the second day.

				'The first verses of the Book of Genesis raise questions that have intrigued scholars for centuries. Here\'s one question: What is the nature of the Darkness and Light mentioned at the beginning of the creation story?',
				'Does this mean that darkness existed before Creation?',
				'According to Rav Ovadia Seforno (16th century Italy), "darkness" is not a reference to physical darkness at all, but is rather a euphemism for Air, one of the four classical elements.',
				'There are three times the word "darkness" is used, but what if they do not all mean the same thing?',
				'We usually think of night as the absence of the sun. But in the creation story, the sun and moon have not yet been created. So what does it mean when it says that God "called the darkness Night"?',
				'Rabbi David Kimchi, the Radak (13th century Provence), acknowledges that night is the time period which is absent of light, but also recognizes that this noun is abstract because it is defined by the absence of something else - like death is the absence of life, or nudity is the absence of clothing. Maybe the Radak is teaching that since darkness is intangible it is also undefinable? ',
				'Now that we understand that darkness might not be something physical, let\'s explore what the Torah means here by "light."',
				'Darkness existed, and here light is created. But without the sun, what does \'light\' mean here?',
				'Rabbi Naftali Tzvi Yehudah Berlin, the Netziv (19th century Lithuania), acknowledges that light, and darkness as well, are not physical things in this section of the Torah. He goes on to note that unlike every other day in the creation story, here it says "let there be light, and there was light," whereas in every other day it will say "let there be... and it was so." Why is the Torah drawing our attention to light in this way?',
				'Now that light is created, it would seem that perhaps darkness and light may coexist.',
				'Here is the first mention of the relationship between darkness and light, which are now distinct which leads to the question of what the Torah means by "separate"?',
				'Ramban (13th century Spain) is making a very important distinction here, noting that the darkness mentioned in verse two cannot be the same as that mentioned here. Similarly to Seforno, Ramban understands the first mention of darkness to refer to one of the four classical elements. However, while Seforno understands darkness to refer to Air, Ramban understands darkness to refer to Fire. By qualifying that this "fire," which is darkness, implies the absence of light. Therefore, for Ramban, the light mentioned here is not permanent, and the darkness mentioned here is the actual absence of light, as opposed to referring to one of the four classical elements.',
				'Rashi (11th century France) understands that the word "good" specifically references the light, and that this is the reason the two must be separated. He is suggesting that the light and darkness cannot coexist, in the same way that goodness and wickedness cannot coexist. Rashi\'s viewpoint, then, is similar to the Natziv that the Torah is addressing abstract concepts and not physics.',
				'Just as it has been unclear if the darkness and light mentioned here are physical in nature. Can "day" mean daylight hours if sun has not yet been created in this narrative?',
				'Similarly, are we to understand that "night" here implies the absence of day?',
				'Notice that in mentioning :"day," the name of God is used, but not in connection to "night"',
				'Chizkuni (13th century France) here is referencing a Midrash that teaches that God\'s name can only be associated with things that are "good," and since light is associated with "good," God\'s name is used. However, according to the Midrash, darkness would be associated with "bad," and this is why God\'s name is not mentioned, similar to Rashi\'s comment.',
				'another way to understand Chizkuni\'s teaching is that when the Torah uses the word "good," it implies stability, so when it says the light is "good," it means it is stable; darkness, on the other hand, is inherently unstable because of the absence of light.',
				'Previously, the Torah used the language of darkness and light, and night and day, but in the final verse it switches to evening and morning',
				'Rashbam (12th century France) offers a very different approach than the others we have seen. Others have focused on abstract concepts and have suggested metaphorical interpretations. Here, Rashbam is informing us that when the Torah uses the language of evening and morning, it refers to the evening and morning we all know - the sun going down at the end of the first day and emerging during the second day ending the night of the first day, and this is why the verse is literally translated "one day," as opposed to "first day," but the next day is referred to as "second day."',
				'No matter how one understands these verses, we can see just from the small selection of commentaries we considered that there are so many ways to interpret what may have seemed to be very simple verses, and that it is anything but simple. Has your understanding of what the Torah means by light and darkness changed? Do you agree with one commentator more than another? Go explore the Sefaria library to find much more...'
